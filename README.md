Yatzy Prompts
=============

This is a starting position for working on the [Yatzy Kata](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/yatzy.html)

The idea is to introduce the Typist and Navigator roles. The exercise should take about half an hour. 

* Divide into pairs and designate one person typist and the other navigator. Each pair should open an empty project in their IDE (not this one!).

* Give the code in Prompt1 to the first navigator and ask them not to show it to the typist. They should talk to the typist and explain in words what they should type. The idea is to write the same code as in the prompt, and for the test to pass. 

* After a time limit of about 7-10 minutes, (or when the test passes), stop coding and debrief. 
	* What was it like for the navigator describing code without typing anything?
	* Did the typist understand straight away? 
	* What kinds of things did you say to help them when stuck?
	* Were there any words/vocabulary you needed but didnâ€™t know? (eg curly bracket)
	* How did it feel to be a typist? Was it stressful?


* Swap roles and give Prompt2 to the new navigator. Again, they should talk to the typist and explain in words what they should type. After 7-10 minutes, debrief for 2-3 minutes. 

Follow up this exercise with a fuller explanation of the ensemble roles including Supporter. Join up pairs to form groups of 3-4 and set up an ensemble timer for each. Starting from this repo's starting position, ask them to implement the rest of Yatzy, working as an ensemble.
